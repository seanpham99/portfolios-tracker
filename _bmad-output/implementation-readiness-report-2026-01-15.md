### PRD Completeness Assessment

The PRD is comprehensive, with clear vision, success criteria, and detailed user journeys. It provides a solid foundation for mapping requirements to implementable stories. One minor ambiguity noted is the specific "Global Stocks" provider for on-demand ingestion (mentions yfinance/Polygon in passing), which should be clarified during implementation.

- **Coverage percentage:** 100%

## UX Alignment Assessment

### UX Document Status

**Found:** `_bmad-output/project-planning-artifacts/ux/ux-design-specification.md`

### Alignment Issues

None identified. A critical shift in navigation strategy (from "Asset Class Silos" to a "Unified Portfolio Dashboard") was correctly identified during the UX design phase and has been fully propagated to the Epics and Stories (Epic 1).

### Findings & Observations

- **Traceability:** The 3-click drill-down requirement (Dashboard -> Portfolio -> Asset -> Transaction) is explicitly mapped in the UX Journeys and supported by Story 1.3, 1.4, and 2.2.
- **Architectural Support:** The proposed technology stack (Next.js, Radix UI, TanStack Query) is well-suited for the complex tabbed navigation and "calm" micro-interactions (200ms transitions) defined in the UX spec.
- **Resilience UX:** The UX requirement for staleness badges (>5m) is technically supported by the "Graceful Degradation" architecture pattern and the shared API response envelope containing "staleness" metadata.

### Warnings

- **Default Portfolio Behavior:** While the UX and Epics support a Multi-Portfolio list view, initial setup might attempt to default to a single portfolio. Ensure Story 1.3 (Dashboard Card View) is fully implemented to prevent an "only-one-portfolio" lock-in early in development.

## Epic Quality Review

### Quality Findings

The epics and stories were reviewed against adversarial standards for user value, independence, and implementation readiness.

#### 🔴 Critical Violations

- **None:** No forward dependencies or purely technical epics found.

#### 🟠 Major Issues (Risk identified)

- **"Value Void" in Epic 1:** Epic 1 establishes the dashboard and models but contains no story for data entry. A user completing Epic 1 would see an empty "Cockpit" with no UI-driven way to populate it until Epic 2. This delays the "Time to Value" significantly.
  - **Impact:** Decreased perceived value of the first milestone.
  - **Recommendation:** Move **Story 2.1 (Manual Transaction Entry)** into Epic 1, immediately following Story 1.2, to complete the "Create Portfolio -> Add Asset -> View Dashboard" loop within the first epic.

#### 🟡 Minor Concerns

- **Story 1.2 Scope:** "Core Domain Models & Shared Types" is broadly defined. There is a risk of implementing all database tables upfront (a violation of "create tables when needed").
  - **Remediation:** Refine Story 1.2 implementation task to focus ONLY on User, Portfolio, and UnifiedHolding entities required for the dashboard.
- **Metric Calculations:** Story 2.3 (FIFO) is in Epic 2, but Story 1.4 (Detail View) claims to show P/L.
  - **Observed Gap:** Epic 1 will likely show "Price only" P/L (current vs cost 0 or placeholder) until the full FIFO engine is implemented in Epic 2.

### Best Practices Compliance Checklist

- [x] **User Value:** All epics deliver tangible user value.
- [x] **Independence:** Epics are logically sequenced without forward dependencies.
- [x] **Sizing:** Stories (21 total) are appropriately sized for session-based completion.
- [x] **No Forward Dependencies:** No story references future implementation items.
- [x] **Database Timing:** Rules are established, though Story 1.2 requires discipline during execution.
- [x] **Acceptance Criteria:** BDD structure (Given/When/Then) is followed throughout.
- [x] **Traceability:** 100% mapping to PRD FRs confirmed.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status: **READY**

The **portfolios-tracker** planning artifacts are of high quality and exhibit excellent traceability from vision to implementation stories. All functional requirements are covered, and the architecture is robustly aligned with the UX goals.

### Critical Issues Resolved

- **Epic 1 Value Gap [RESOLVED]:** Story 2.1 (Manual Transaction Entry) has been moved into Epic 1 as Story 1.3. This completes the "Create Portfolio -> Add Asset -> View Dashboard" loop within the first milestone.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Refine Foundation Story (1.2):** Ensure the implementation of shared types and models follows the "create entities when needed" rule to avoid over-engineering the initial database schema.
2. **Data Provider Clarification:** Confirm the specific API limits and costs for the "Global Stocks" provider (Polygon vs yfinance) before starting Epic 1.
3. **Begin Implementation:** Setup the monorepo foundation using the starter template.

### Final Note

This assessment confirms that the project is now fully positioned for a successful Phase 4 implementation.
