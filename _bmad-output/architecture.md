# Architecture Decision Document

## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements:**
The system must unify tracking for VN stocks, US equities, Global Equities, and Crypto, requiring complex data normalization. Key features include professional analytics with TradingView integration, transparent calculation methodologies (drill-down to formulas), and multi-currency handling (separation of FX vs. asset gains). The system also requires secure payment integrations (SePay) and automated crypto exchange syncing.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
Architecture must support high performance (P95 < 200ms) with a specific polling strategy (~60s) and staleness indicators (>5m). Security is paramount, with strict adherence to PDPA/GDPR, secure webhook handling, and Supabase RLS. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and "calm" UX design principles (handling volatility without panic) drive frontend architecture. Global stock support is powered universally by Yahoo Finance.

**Scale & Complexity:**

- Primary domain: Fintech SaaS (Web Application)
- Complexity level: High (Multi-asset normalization, Cross-border complexities, Brownfield integration)
- Estimated architectural components: ~12 (Frontend, NestJS API, Supabase Auth/DB, Redis Cache, ClickHouse Analytics, Airflow ETL, 3+ External APIs, Payment Gateways)

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

- **Brownfield Integration:** Must seamlessly extend existing Airflow/ClickHouse data pipeline.
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16.1.2 (React 19.2.3), Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI/Shadcn UI, TanStack Query 5, Recharts.
- **Backend:** NestJS 11.1.10, Swagger 11.2.3 (OpenAPI), Supabase JS 2.89, Upstash Redis 1.36, CCXT 4.5.29.
- **Shared Packages:** `@workspace/shared-types` (DTOs/Schemas), `@workspace/ui` (Primitives).
- **Core Infrastructure:** Turborepo 2.7.4 with pnpm 10.26.2. Supabase (Auth/Postgres), Upstash (Redis), ClickHouse (Analytics).

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

- **Hybrid Data Patterns:** "Hybrid Read Path" separating fast user feedback (NestJS/Redis) from deep analytics (ClickHouse).
- **Calm UX via Resilience:** "Graceful Degradation" patterns for stale data and external API failures.
- **Lazy-Load Asset Registry:** On-demand data ingestion for global assets to manage costs and scale.
- **Testability:** Simulation of external API failures (Contract Testing) to validate resiliency.
- **Multi-Currency & FX:** Centralized logic for currency conversion and gain/loss separation is required across all modules.

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Primary Technology Domain

Fintech Web Application (Full-Stack) based on project requirements analysis.

### Starter Options Considered

- **Monorepo (Turborepo + pnpm):** Highly efficient for shared business logic and type safety across NestJS/React. Essential for mid-to-high complexity fintech apps.
- **Split Repositories:** Maximum isolation but high friction for shared types and schema synchronization.

### Selected Starter: Turborepo Full-Stack Monorepo

**Rationale for Selection:**
Ensures strict financial data consistency between the NestJS backend and React frontend through shared type packages. Supports scalable, modular development while reducing the overhead of managing multiple repositories.

**Initialization Command:**

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest ./ --example kitchen-sink
```

**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**

**Language & Runtime:**
TypeScript 5.x for end-to-end type safety. **ESM-First Imports REQUIRED** (internal imports must include `.js` extension). Financial calculations must use string-based decimals (no floats).

**Styling Solution:**
Tailwind CSS 4 + Shadcn UI (Radix UI) for a professional, accessible, and "calm" interface. Mobile-first responsiveness.

**Build Tooling:**
Next.js 16 with Turbopack/Webpack (optimized via Turborepo 2.7.4 caching).

**Testing Framework:**
Frontend: Vitest + @testing-library/react. Backend: Jest. E2E: Playwright.

**Code Organization:**
Modular monorepo structure with `@workspace/shared-types`, `@workspace/ui`.

**Development Experience:**
Fast HMR, unified linting/formatting (ESLint/Prettier), and centralized dependency management.

**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**

- **Database Interface:** Supabase JS 2.89 / PostgREST for transactional data. (Verification: Drizzle was previously discussed but Project Context prioritizes Supabase JS/Shared Types).
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with RLS (Row Level Security) as the primary security layer.

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**

- **Universal Global Asset Registry:** On-demand ingestion of any global market data via Yahoo Finance to manage costs.
- **Graceful Degradation:** UI-first handling of stale data and API timeouts to maintain "Calm" UX.
- **Monorepo Strategy:** Turborepo for shared types between calculation services and frontend.

**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**

- **Snapshot-Based Scaling:** High-volume scalability (CQRS) deferred to Phase 2.
- **WebSocket Updates:** Initial MVP will use smart polling cadence (~60s).

### Data Architecture

- **Transactional Store (Postgres/Supabase):** Stores users, portfolios, and trade history.
  - **Interface:** Supabase JS v2.89.
  - **Rationale:** Native integration with RLS and optimized for the chosen platform.
- **Analytics Store (ClickHouse):** Stores historical price snapshots and performs technical indicator math. (v25.x stable).
- **Hot Cache (Upstash Redis):** Stores transient market prices and session state. (v1.36).

### Authentication & Security

- **Identity Provider:** Supabase Auth.
- **Authorization:** PostgreSQL RLS for multi-tenant data isolation + NestJS Guards for feature-level access.
- **Security Protocol:** TLS 1.3, modern JWT verification (local signing keys and asymmetric cryptography).

### API & Communication Patterns

- **Pattern:** REST API (NestJS).
- **Documentation:** Swagger / OpenAPI 3.x.
- **Sync Strategy:** Asynchronous 'Asset Onboarding' via BullMQ for global assets backfilling.

### Frontend Architecture

- **State Management:** Zustand (Local app state) + TanStack Query (Server state orchestration).

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence:**

1. Initialize Turborepo & NestJS/React apps.
2. Configure Supabase Auth & Drizzle Connection.
3. Implement Shared `Asset` and `Trade` types.
4. Scaffold `AssetService` with 'Lazy-Load' logic.

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**
The `PortfolioCalculator` shared service depends on the unified `Trade[]` type from the shared package, ensuring frontend and backend always agree on performance metrics.

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

### Pattern Categories Defined

**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**
5 areas where AI agents could make different choices, prioritized for monorepo consistency and financial accuracy.

### Naming Patterns

**Database Naming Conventions:**

- **Tables:** `snake_case` (e.g., `portfolio_holdings`).
- **Columns:** `snake_case` in DB, mapped to `camelCase` in Drizzle schemas (e.g., `user_id` -> `userId`).
- **Keys/Indices:** `idx_{table}_{column}`, `fk_{table}_{target}`.

**API Naming Conventions:**

- **Endpoints:** Plural and kebab-case (e.g., `/api/v1/user-portfolios`).
- **Query Params:** `camelCase` (e.g., `?portfolioId=...`).
- **Version:** Prefix with `/v1/`.

**Code Naming Conventions:**

- **Files:** `kebab-case` for React components (`user-card.tsx`) and NestJS modules (`auth.module.ts`).
- **Classes/Components:** `PascalCase` (`UserCard`, `AuthService`).
- **Variables/Functions:** `camelCase`.

### Structure Patterns

**Project Organization:**

- **Shared Types:** All DTOs and Database models live in `@workspace/shared-types`. AI Agents **MUST** use `supabase-types.ts` via the `@workspace/shared-types/database` export for all entity definitions to ensure consistency with the schema.
- **UI Components:** Reusable primitive components live in `@workspace/ui`.

**File Structure Patterns:**

- **Tests:** Co-located `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts` files for unit tests.
- **E2E:** Dedicated `apps/e2e` or `tests/` folder for playwright scenarios.

### Format Patterns

**API Response Formats:**

- **Standard Envelope:**

  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": { ... },
    "error": null,
    "meta": { "staleness": "ISO-TIMESTAMP" }
  }
  ```

- **Error Format:** `{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "STRING", "message": "STRING" } }`.

**Data Exchange Formats:**

- **Dates:** ISO 8601 strings.
- **Decimals:** Strings for high-precision financial figures to avoid float precision issues.

### Communication Patterns

**State Management Patterns:**

- **Server State:** TanStack Query as the source of truth for all external data.
- **Global App State:** Zustand for lightweight UI state and session preferences.
- **Immutability:** Required for all state updates.

### Process Patterns

**Error Handling Patterns:**

- **Calm Error Strategy:** Background sync/polling failures must use non-blocking "Staleness Banners" or status badges.
- **Validation:** Frontend Zod validation mirroring backend DTO validation.

**Loading State Patterns:**

- **Skeletons:** Preferred over global spinners for "Calm" feel.
- **Lazy Loading:** Critical for heavy charts (TradingView) and off-screen panels.

### Enforcement Guidelines

**All AI Agents MUST:**

- Use shared `@workspace/` packages for types and finance logic.
- Follow the API Response Envelope for all new endpoints.
- **ESM-First Imports**: Internal imports must include the `.js` extension.
- Never use floating point math for money; use string-based decimal logic.

**Pattern Enforcement:**

- **Linting:** Shared ESLint/Prettier configs in the monorepo root.
- **Review:** Any divergence from the shared finance logic must be flagged as an architectural violation.

```

### Architectural Boundaries

**API Boundaries:**

- **Public Gateway:** NestJS Controllers mapping to `/api/v1/*`.
- **Data Boundary:** Only `packages/database` can issue direct Drizzle queries. Apps must use shared schemas in `packages/types`.
- **External Boundary:** All 3rd party API calls (Binance/TradingView) must be wrapped in `api/src/providers` with error handling for "Graceful Degradation".

**Component Boundaries:**

- **UI Logic:** Primitive UI components in `@workspace/ui` must be stateless.
- **Feature Logic:** Portfolios/Assets features in `apps/web/src/features` manage local state via hooks.

**Data Boundaries:**

- **Shared Schemas:** Defined in `@workspace/shared-types`. Apps must import these; local reassignment is an ANTI-PATTERN.
- **Analytics Isolation:** ClickHouse queries restricted to dedicated analytics micro-services or modules.

### Requirements to Structure Mapping

**Feature/Epic Mapping:**

- **Multi-Asset Support (VN, Global, Crypto):** Logic in `apps/api`.
- **Unified Dashboard:** UI in `apps/web/src/features/dashboard`, server state in `apps/web/src/hooks`.

**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**

- **Calm UX (Resilience):** Handled via TanStack Query retries in `apps/web/src/hooks` and status badges.
- **Security & RLS:** Defined in `packages/database` schemas and enforced via Supabase.

### Integration Points

**Internal Communication:**
Monorepo package imports for styles, types, and logic. REST API communication between `web` and `api`.

**External Integrations:**
Webhooks from SePay to `apps/api/src/modules/payments`. API polling to Crypto/Stock providers.

**Data Flow:**
User Transaction -> NestJS API -> Postgres (Active) -> BullMQ (Sync Job) -> ClickHouse (Historical).
