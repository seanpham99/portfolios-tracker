# Introducing Portfolio Tracker

We are thrilled to announce the public launch of **Portfolio Tracker**, the ultimate tool for modern investors.

## Why we built this

Managing finances across multiple brokerage accounts, crypto wallets, and bank accounts has become a nightmare. Spreadsheets are manual, error-prone, and ugly. Existing apps are either too expensive or lack support for modern assets like DeFi and NFTs.

We decided to build something better.

## Key Features

- **Unified Dashboard**: See all your assets in one place.
- **Transactions**: Automatic import and classification.
- **Analytics**: Real-time performance metrics.
- **Privacy First**: Your data is yours. We sell no data.

## Getting Started

Getting started is easy. Just [create an account](/signup), connect your institutions via Plaid, and add your crypto wallet addresses. We handle the rest.

Stay tuned for more updates!
